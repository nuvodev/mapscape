---------Music---------
In order to download music the game has to restart and has already replaced the music file before playing it.
Playing it and then downloading the new music would make the music silent.
It is unknown why it happens but limitations cause creativity.
Pressing F12 when leaving a NetMap will resolve this issue quickly without having to relaunch the game over and over.
Right now, this is the only issue with Mapscape so anything else will be stated when discovered.
